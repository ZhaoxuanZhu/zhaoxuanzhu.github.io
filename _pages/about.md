Hello, I am a final year Ph.D student from The Ohio State University. I was born in Shanxi, China, and I am currently living in Columbus, Ohio.  

My background is centered around automotive technologies since my undergraduate study. Specifically in the past 5 years, my studies were on the use of machine learning (mostly unsupervised learning and reinforcement learning) to tackle challenges in the automotive field. The applications I have worked on includes:
1. Reinforcement learning for Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs) energy management, Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) and Autonomous Vehicles (AVs). 
2. Model order reduction for automotive aftertreatment devices and Li-on batteries. 

Outside of research, I like tech-related things and sports including lifting and basketball.
